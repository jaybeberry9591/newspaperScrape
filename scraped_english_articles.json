          "text": "The Modhumoti Model Town developers continue operations while the government authorities turn a blind eye -- both failing to comply with the highest court's verdict on retaining the flood flow zone in Savar where the housing project was built illegally.\n\nThe project, first declared illegal by the High Court in 2005, remains active in the area apparently under a new name, \"Nandonik Housing\", as seen during a recent visit by The Daily Star.\n\nNot only this, plot owners are still attempting to change the status of the project area despite the Supreme Court declaring it illegal and rejecting earlier review petitions.\n\nThe housing and public works ministry recently sent a letter to Rajuk, asking it to take necessary steps to incorporate the project as an urban area or withdraw it from the sub flood flow zone in the Detailed Area Plan (DAP).\n\nThe noncompliance with the order to retain the flood flow zone and the recent letter of the ministry, following an application by the plot owners, are brazen violations of the apex court judgment, said experts.\n\nThe full bench of the Supreme Court on April 25, 2019 quashed five review petitions while upholding its earlier verdict that had directed the authorities concerned to restore the wetland on which Modhumoti Model Town illegally developed its housing project.\n\nThe SC had ordered the project owner Metro Makers and Developers Limited to complete the restoration of the wetland in six months, dismantling all the construction of the 550-acre project. The land is identified as floodplain in the 1997 Dhaka City Master Plan.\n\nThe apex court also ordered the project owners to refund all plot buyers double the amount, including the registration fees.\n\nBesides, the SC directed Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) to reclaim the wetland in case the project owners failed to complete the restoration within the six-month period.\n\n\"But more than a year after the SC verdict, the project is still there and no structure or building was demolished or removed from the place, even no earth has been removed from the project area so far,\" Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela), told The Daily Star recently.\n\nBela filed a writ petition with the High Court in August 2004 challenging the legality of the project, saying it was developed violating the Environment Conservation Act, Town Improvement Act, and Rajuk rules.\n\nNEW NAME, NEW GUISE\n\nDuring a recent visit to the project area near Aminbazar, The Daily Star found nothing changed other than the previous large signboard of Modhumoti Model Town missing from the entrance of the housing project.\n\nRather, there was only a small notice board which mentions the project's name as \"Nandonik Housing\".\n\nThere was also a noticeably large signboard at the centre of the housing area with the following messages -- the project was \"built without obstructing flood flow\", there are \"two lakh trees, a beautiful wide lake\" and that it is the \"dream of 1.5 lakh people of 3,000 families\".\n\nInside the housing area, many plots were demarcated by walls. Some plots had signs with the owner's names on them, still mentioning Modhumoti Model Town as the title of the housing project.\n\nAbdullah Sheikh, a staffer at the project office, said they have been using the name \"Nandonik Housing\" instead of Modhumoti Model Town for the last one year.\n\nHe said the housing project comprises 6,000 plots of 4,000 owners. And the plot owners are now overseeing the project and some are selling their plots to third parties.\n\nAccording to the project office, 20 duplex houses, eight resorts, around 300 one-storey buildings, and 150 tin-shed houses have already been constructed there.\n\nContacted, AF Kallol, president of the plot owners' association, said he would give a comment regarding the court order and the recent application to the public works ministry later on.\n\nBut afterward, he did not pick up this correspondent's phone calls.\n\nThe Daily Star also repeatedly attempted to contact officials of Metro Makers and Developers Limited, but their phones were found switched off. On a visit two weeks ago, this correspondent found the company's headquarters in the city's Green Road area under lock and key.\n\nNON-COMPLIANCE WITH SC VERDICT\n\nRajuk Chairman Sayeed Noor Alam told The Daily Star recently that they have formed a committee to take necessary steps after the Supreme Court verdict on the matter.\n\nHe said they have held a meeting around five to six months ago and asked all departments concerned to take necessary steps to follow the SC order. He, however, did not specify what steps they have taken so far in line with the SC verdict.\n\nPlanning section-3 of the housing and public works ministry, in a letter to Rajuk dated October 18, 2020, asked the latter to take necessary steps to incorporate the project as an urban area or withdraw it from the sub flood flow zone in the DAP.\n\nThe letter was issued following an application by plot owners of Modhumoti Model Town on September 17 last year.\n\n\"We have asked [Rajuk] in the letter to take action as per the rules. [But] if the Supreme Court has given this directive, it will not get approval,\" said an official of the planning section at the ministry, when asked about the plot owners' application.\n\nThe official, preferring to remain anonymous, said they were not informed about the court verdict. \"Besides, the applicants also hid that information in the letter addressed to us.\"\n\nRegarding the matter, Rajuk Chairman Sayeed Noor Alam said, \"Their application will not be acceptable as there is a restriction from the court.\"\n\nRegarding these developments, Bela's Rizwana Hasan said, \"When a project is announced illegal twice by a highest court of the country and when the review petition of plots owners is rejected by the Supreme Court, then there is no scope of its inclusion as an urban area in the DAP.\"\n\nShe said following the SC verdict, there is no scope for the plot owners to submit any application like this and for the government authorities to entertain it.\n\n\"If the authorities concerned consider its application, then it means the executive division will interfere with the jurisdiction of the court and it would be a classic case of contempt of court,\" she said.\n\nIt is very important to restore the wetland to establish rule of law, she added.\n\nLONG LEGAL BATTLE\n\nIn its petition filed with the High Court in 2004, Bela mentioned that if the project continued, the character of the area would be destroyed and the environment would be polluted.\n\nThe HC on July 27, 2005, declared the project unauthorised, illegal, and against public interest. It also said the interest of the buyers must be protected.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the HC verdict on August 7, 2012 and declared Modhumoti Model Town illegal. The apex court directed the authorities concerned to keep the area as a free flood flow zone.\n\nOn July 11, 2013, the Appellate Division released the full text of its 159-page verdict directing Metro Makers and Developers Limited to restore within six months the wetland in Bilamalia and Baliarpur mouzas of Savar where it had developed the project.\n\nThe apex court came up with the verdict to keep the area as a free flood flow zone and protect the capital from waterlogging.\n\nIn September 2013, Metro Makers and Developers Limited and plot purchasers moved five separate petitions with the Supreme Court seeking review of its judgment.\n\nThe full bench of the SC dismissed all five review petitions and upheld its earlier verdict on April 25, 2019.\n\nTIMELINE\n\nAug 2004\n\nBela files petition with HC against Modhumoti Model Town project\n\nJuly 2005\n\nHC declares the project \"illegal\", \"unauthorised\";\n\nAug 2012\n\nSC upholds HC verdict\n\nJuly 2013\n\nThe Appellate Division releases full verdict; project developers given 6 moths to restore wetland, dismantle all construction\n\nSept 2013\n\nMetro Makers and Developers Limited and plot purchasers move five petitions with the SC seeking review of judgment\n\nApril 2019\n\nSC bench dismisses all five petitions\n\nSept 2020\n\nPlot owners apply to housing ministry for incorporation as urban area or withdraw it from sub flow flood zone in DAP\n\nOct 2020\n\nHousing ministry sends letter to Rajuk in this regard\n\nG M T\n\nDetect language Afrikaans Albanian Amharic Arabic Armenian Azerbaijani Basque Belarusian Bengali Bosnian Bulgarian Catalan Cebuano Chichewa Chinese (Simplified) Chinese (Traditional) Corsican Croatian Czech Danish Dutch English Esperanto Estonian Filipino Finnish French Frisian Galician Georgian German Greek Gujarati Haitian Creole Hausa Hawaiian Hebrew Hindi Hmong Hungarian Icelandic Igbo Indonesian Irish Italian Japanese Javanese Kannada Kazakh Khmer Korean Kurdish Kyrgyz Lao Latin Latvian Lithuanian Luxembourgish Macedonian Malagasy Malay Malayalam Maltese Maori Marathi Mongolian Myanmar (Burmese) Nepali Norwegian Pashto Persian Polish Portuguese Punjabi Romanian Russian Samoan Scots Gaelic Serbian Sesotho Shona Sindhi Sinhala Slovak Slovenian Somali Spanish Sundanese Swahili Swedish Tajik Tamil Telugu Thai Turkish Ukrainian Urdu Uzbek Vietnamese Welsh Xhosa Yiddish Yoruba Zulu\n\nAfrikaans Albanian Amharic Arabic Armenian Azerbaijani Basque Belarusian Bengali Bosnian Bulgarian Catalan Cebuano Chichewa Chinese (Simplified) Chinese (Traditional) Corsican Croatian Czech Danish Dutch English Esperanto Estonian Filipino Finnish French Frisian Galician Georgian German Greek Gujarati Haitian Creole Hausa Hawaiian Hebrew Hindi Hmong Hungarian Icelandic Igbo Indonesian Irish Italian Japanese Javanese Kannada Kazakh Khmer Korean Kurdish Kyrgyz Lao Latin Latvian Lithuanian Luxembourgish Macedonian Malagasy Malay Malayalam Maltese Maori Marathi Mongolian Myanmar (Burmese) Nepali Norwegian Pashto Persian Polish Portuguese Punjabi Romanian Russian Samoan Scots Gaelic Serbian Sesotho Shona Sindhi Sinhala Slovak Slovenian Somali Spanish Sundanese Swahili Swedish Tajik Tamil Telugu Thai Turkish Ukrainian Urdu Uzbek Vietnamese Welsh Xhosa Yiddish Yoruba Zulu\n\nText-to-speech function is limited to 200 characters\n\nOptions : History : Feedback : Donate\n\nClose"

          "text": "The government should explore more sources of Covid-19 vaccines, instead of relying only on the ones currently being considered, and take part in vaccine trials immediately to meet future needs, experts say.\n\nThey also said the country's overall vaccination efforts may turn futile if people did not accept the vaccines \"positively\".\n\nThe experts made the comment while speaking at a discussion at the Bangladesh Medical Association (BMA) conference room in the capital yesterday. Bangladesh Health Reporters Forum (BHRF) organised the event as part of a series of dialogues on Covid-19.\n\nBangladesh has already made an advance payment of Tk 509 crore for three crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine from Serum Institute India (SII). The government has also announced that it will procure 68 million shots of vaccine under a global arrangement called COVAX.\n\n\"We do not know how long these vaccines will give us immunity. If the novel coronavirus regularly mutates -- like the influenza virus -- we may need regular vaccination. In this case, we should think of sustainable sources,\" Prof Sayedur Rahman, chairman of BSMMU's pharmacology department, said at the discussion yesterday.\n\nAbout vaccine selection, he said, \"Safety, efficacy and standard are the three basic parameters to select any vaccine. The dose is another issue. If we can select a single-dose vaccine, it would be better for our country.\"\n\nHe said six Covid-19 vaccines were already in the market while another 14 were in the pipeline.\n\nHe mentioned that several of these vaccines would be safer, effective and viable for countries like Bangladesh in the coming days.\n\nHe recommended increasing the chances of getting vaccines from other potential sources. \"Political, diplomatic, and economic drives increase the probability of getting vaccines \u2026 This discussion is not under my jurisdiction. But from the scientific point of view, we can increase our potentiality to get vaccines either by inventing locally or taking part in researches along with others \u2026 Currently, Bangladesh is now among the 10 best countries worthy of conducting trials. We should make the best use of it.\"\n\nIn his presentation, Prof Sayedur, also member of the Ethics Committee of the Bangladesh Medical Research Council, lauded the government's National Vaccine Deployment Plan. \"\u2026 But the success of the vaccination programme depends on the acceptability of vaccines. If the vaccination programme is not based on science and social context, it will fail. Here, transparency is the key ... .\n\n\"It is important that people don't think that there is any disparity in vaccination,\" he said.\n\nEchoing the view, public health expert Abu Zamil Faisal said, \"If we take part in phase-III vaccine trials, getting vaccines will be easier in future. The private sector can be encouraged in this regard.\n\n\"If a portion of the population do not want to take the vaccines, then what will be done? We should think of it now,\" he said.\n\nConnecting to the event via online, Prof Meerjady Sabrina Flora, additional director general of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), spoke about their preparation for vaccinating people upon availability of the shots.\n\n\"We have made the priority list considering different issues \u2026 The making of an app for the registration was at the final stage. We've already provided necessary training to our manpower and procurement of logistics was underway,\" she said.\n\nCommenting on Prof Flora's remarks, Prof Rashid-E-Mahbub, former president of the BMA, said, \"We don't know when the app will be ready. We also don't know whether people will be able to access the app.\"\n\nComing down heavily on the government's deal with Beximco Pharmaceutical Ltd on vaccine procurement, he said, \"It is not clear who is bringing the vaccines -- Beximco or the government? The government said the vaccine will be free of cost. But for whom, please clarify.\"\n\nJoining the event online, former health minister AFM Ruhul Haque also spoke in favour of exploring other sources of vaccines and more collaboration to implement the vaccine deployment plan.\n\nProf Syed Abdul Hamid of Dhaka University's health economics said, \"The country has the financial capacity to procure vaccines. But it is important to think of whether people will take the vaccines or not.\"\n\nPresided over by BHRF President Toufiq Maruf, BMA President Prof Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin and Swachip president MA Aziz also spoke at the event, among others.\n\nMeanwhile, Health Minister Zahid Maleque at another event yesterday said many countries were eager to give vaccines to Bangladesh. \"We have kept our doors open for all,\" he said."

          "text": "The European Union is moving from a development partner of Bangladesh to trade partner as Bangladesh is graduating to a developing country by 2024. After 50 years of Bangladesh's independence, how does the EU look at its relationship with the country? Rensje Teerink, EU Ambassador to Bangladesh, shared her thoughts in a recent interview with The Daily Star.\n\nTDS: How do you assess Bangladesh's progress?\n\nTeerink: Bangladesh has been a very trusted partner of the EU since its birth in 1971. In the first decade, the relationship was characterised by development assistance. We worked with NGOs like Brac, Proshika and GSS that were filling in the gaps where the government had some challenges. Our main development funds were directed through these NGOs. I must say that our relations has now enormously moved to trade.\n\nTDS: How has that relationship changed?\n\nTeerink: EBA (Everything But Arms) has been the game changer. That has enabled Bangladesh to step in and focus on RMG exports to the EU. It is admirable how Bangladesh used the opportunity. It really lifted the RMG and textile to become the second largest producer in the world. Out of 47 countries under EBA, Bangladesh is the biggest beneficiary. Some 60 percent of the benefits were actually reaped by Bangladesh. It is really the one country that stands out. The vision and the strong determination that the government is showing as it moves towards graduation from Least Developing Country (LDC).\n\nTDS: Businesses have been affected due to the pandemic. Are you taking any new strategy?\n\nTeerink: We need to be proud of Bangladesh that it has been able to provide stimulus packages and find ways to continue businesses and help the people during the pandemic. This is where we want to step in and provide support. In the first wave, Germany and we came up with assistance of \u20ac130 million for social protection scheme. That will go as payments to the workers of the RMG, leather and footwear industries. The payment is not one off. The first disbursement of our frontloading money would actually be a pilot. The ultimate goal is to help Bangladesh become a country that has a social security system. That will also be important for the country to achieve the SDGs and eventually become a developed country by 2041.\n\nTDS: What are the challenges that Bangladesh faces at this juncture of time?\n\nTeerink: Bangladesh needs to be vigilant and ensure its economic situation remains stable during the pandemic. For example, we have seen some glitches in the global supply chain where Bangladesh has suffered along with many other countries. There, we have looked at the whole question of mandatory due diligence. Hopefully, the EU will pass a new law on it. That will shield the RMG companies from the situation where buyers have not lived up to the promises of honouring orders or paying for orders that have already been produced. We need to work on that, and in 2021 we hope to have a sustainability compact in Bangladesh.\n\nAnother challenge that Bangladesh faces is the need for diversifying its export basket. So far, the export has been mostly reliant on RMG. The government has already begun working on it. We would also support Bangladesh in many ways, including by encouraging our companies to step up investments. However, we think Bangladesh still needs to do some homework for doing business with ease. We are already engaged with the government and are trying to make it more pragmatic. Our private sector companies are working to single out the main obstacles that prevent EU companies from making bigger investments. I think the business climate would be better in the coming days. Ultimately, it will help Bangladesh a lot.\n\nTDS: How would EU act as Bangladesh transitions from LDC to a developing country?\n\nTeerink: We have been working on the Multi-Annual Financial Framework for seven years. That is going to be 1.8 trillion Euro package. Euro 800 billion is basically for the Covid response in Europe. More than one trillion Euros will be for development cooperation and other aspects. That means we can start working over seven years and Bangladesh will remain an important partner country. We will be working in the next few months on the allocation for Bangladesh. Humanitarian assistance will always be there if there is a humanitarian crisis. As of now, we see trade to be important. We are also in the process of adapting GSP Plus. We don't know at this stage what it would look like but we hope Bangladesh would be ready to be eligible for the GSP Plus scheme.\n\nTDS: What are the criteria that can make Bangladesh eligible for GSP Plus?\n\nTeerink: Bangladesh needs to respect the human rights and ILO conventions. The GSP Plus has more of these conventions than the EBA. It requires improvement of not only human rights and labour rights, but also environmental rights. That's quite a big package of convention for which Bangladesh needs to make some progress. I think the country has already signed on most of the ILO conventions right from the time of independence. That's a good step. Very often, it is the matter of implementation that needs progress. The Bangladesh Labour Act has been amended, which is a welcome move. However, it is not enough. It is important that Bangladesh makes progress on the labour rights roadmap. This is an ongoing discussion we are having with the government.\n\nTDS: What about human rights?\n\nTeerink: I must say we are quite pleased with the openness from the government on these issues. For example, we have always been critical of the Digital Security Act because we face a lot of questions in the European Parliament and the EU-based human rights organisations. When they see journalists being arrested, we face questions. So, through our human rights dialogue and diplomatic consultations, we have discussed these with the government. So far, we had a good meeting with the law minister and we are now waiting for a follow-up meeting. I think the discussions were open and frank with good indications of progress. Similarly, we are also following the Universal Periodic Review exercise. There have been some workshops going on where we have been part of the UN. I think those were useful.\n\nTDS: How is the EU cooperating with Bangladesh on climate change?\n\nTeerink: The EU is working on the European Green Deal. This is the new flagship motto that encompasses the measures in meeting the Paris Agreement and mitigating climate change. The goals are reducing 55 percent carbon emission by 2030 and making the EU carbon neutral by 2050. The EU's actions have also prompted other players like China and India to set similar goals. We are now focusing on going away from coal to renewable energy like wind solar. Researches are underway for an experimental reactor in France. Greening the houses, improving energy efficiency and imposing carbon tax on countries that produce without stringent environmental criteria will be the means of future to protect the environment. In Bangladesh, we will focus on decent work and green energy.\n\nAbout cooperation with Bangladesh\u2026 I think the government is very interested about the Delta Plan. It is promising. It is not only about water management but also on tackling climate change. We can work with other donors, international financial institution or private sectors on implementing the plan.\n\nTDS: How do you assess Bangladesh's performance in addressing climate change impacts?\n\nTeerink: I think climate change is very high on Bangladesh's agenda. What is missing in the conversation is environmental protection\u2026 preserving the rivers. The encroachment of rivers cannot just continue unabated because it is endangering the water bodies. Also ensuring food security and keeping the Bay of Bengal safe is important. Blue economy is largely untapped in Bangladesh but it has to be sustainable blue economy. Another thing worth mentioning is the protection of the Sundarbans that saves the country from cyclones. Transport of coals through the Sundarbans' very fragile ecosystem also endangers the forest. If the unique ecosystem, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site, is lost, I think you will never get it back. Bangladesh should do everything that it can to protect the forest. If we could help, we would be very happy to do so."

He helped the accused carry the victim out of the house. He may know something.\"\n\nAbdul Motalib, another security guard of the building in the capital's Kalabagan, said the man police were looking for was Dulal, aged about 45.\n\n\"He was on duty that day. He used to live here. His belongings are here,\" Motalib said, adding that Dulal had not been answering his phone.\n\nA medical officer and a ward-boy of Anwer Khan Medical College Hospital, where the girl was taken at first, said the accused and another young man brought the girl in a car.\n\nDoctors said she died before they reached the hospital.\n\nThe girl's father filed a case with Kalabagan Police Station, accusing 18-year-old Fardin Iftekhar Dihan who recently passed A levels.\n\nMeanwhile, grieving family members of the girl yesterday asked why three friends of the accused were released by police.\n\nAt his village home in Kushtia, the father told reporters that Kalabagan police didn't name the three friends as accused in the case, saying that the case would be \"weak\" if they did.\n\nAbul Hasan said police released them because they didn't find any involvement of the trio. \"We investigate all possible things linked to an incident. We have found evidence at the crime scene.\"\n\nHe added that officers might examine whether the accused took any drugs that day, he added.\n\nPolice have collected CCTV footage from all possible sources and are examining the mobile phones of the accused.\n\nSohel Mahmud, head of forensic department at Dhaka Medical College, told reporters that doctors found evidence of rape and injury marks on the girl's body. He added that the girl died due to hemorrhagic shock and excessive bleeding.\n\nA Dhaka court recorded Dihan's confessional statement on Friday and sent him to jail.\n\nAfter her death, Kalabagan police requested the DMC forensic department to find out the age of the victim and mentioned in the inquest report that she was 19.\n\nHer mother alleged that when she objected and showed police her daughter's passport, the policemen got angry and left the body at the morgue for hours.\n\nContacted, police said the hospital document mentioned her age as 19.\n\nMohammed Aseer Intisar Saarim, emergency medical officer at Anwer Khan hospital, said, \"She was brought dead. I asked the accused what happened to her. He said she was his girlfriend\u2026 he insisted that I write her age as 19\u2026 I said she looked younger. But he objected. Later, the victim's mother came and said she was 17.\"\n\nThe girl was laid to rest at a graveyard in Gopalpur, Kushtia, following a namaz-e-janaza attended by thousands of people.\n\nLocals formed a human chain on both sides of the road in Kamalapur Bazar demanding justice.\n\nGrieving friends of the girl lit candles in her memory on Dhanmondi-27 and demanded changes in education.\n\n\"We want everyone directly or indirectly linked with the rape to be investigated,\" said Neha Zaman, a friend of the girl.\n\nBesides demanding justice, the students and parents also demanded sex education and institutional interventions to teach boys about respect and gender.\n\n\"Sex education is a taboo in our school. The teachers feel awkward,\" said Neha.\n\nHer friends Rudmila and Afrin said the educational institutes have not been their allies while some teachers were victim-blaming by questioning why the girl went to the boy's apartment.\n\nMumtahina Ritu, a parent with two children in the school, said, \"Sex education in schools is needed in this day and age. Secrecy is of no use, because our children learn about sex from other sources. Guardians need to talk to their children about sex.\"\n\nBoys and girls also need to be taught about abuse at the schools, she added.\n\nSharmin Iffa, whose son was a close friend of the girl, stated that parents needed to be more involved in their children's lives. \"The girl used to come to my house as well, because she was friends with my son. It was up to me to make sure that they were all safe.\""
